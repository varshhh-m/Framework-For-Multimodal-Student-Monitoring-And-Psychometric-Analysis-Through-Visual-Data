# Framework-For-Multimodal-Student-Monitoring-And-Psychometric-Analysis-Through-Visual-Data
This work aims to address the pressing need for 
monitoring students' emotional well-being in the classroom by 
combining video data, psychometric tests, and advanced data 
analysis techniques. The work employs video cameras to 
continuously record classroom sessions, capturing students' 
behaviour, expressions, and interactions. It also includes 
psychometric tests, like the 16PF tests, to quantitatively assess 
students' mental health. The collected video data is subjected to 
thorough analysis using computer vision techniques like Multi
Task Cascaded Convolution Neural Network (MTCNN). This 
analysis helps identify patterns and indicators of emotional 
discomfort, such as changes in participation, and facial 
expressions. Additionally, it explores how students interact with 
their peers and teachers. The results of these tests and 
behavioural data are integrated to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of a student's emotional state. One of the key 
aspects of this work is the ability to associate the values obtained 
from both video analysis and psychometric tests. This 
integration enables a more holistic view of a student's emotional well-being, increasing the accuracy of detection.
